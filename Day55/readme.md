## Introduction

This file provides an overview of *getters and setters*—fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming—and *Stack Overflow* in both programming error and online Q&A platform contexts.

## Getters and Setters

### Definition

- **Getter:** A method that retrieves or "gets" the value of a private attribute in a class.
- **Setter:** A method that modifies or "sets" the value of a private attribute in a class[1][2][3].

### Why Use Getters and Setters

- **Encapsulation:** Hide internal representation and protect data from unauthorized external access.
- **Validation:** Add checks or logic before assigning values.
- **Maintenance:** Easily change underlying implementation without affecting external code.
- **Readability:** Standard method signatures make code easier to understand and maintain[2][4][3].

### Examples

#### Python

```python
class Label:
    def __init__(self, text, font):
        self._text = text
        self._font = font

    def get_text(self):
        return self._text

    def set_text(self, value):
        self._text = value
```


#### Java

```java
public class Person {
    private String name; // private = restricted access

    // Getter
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter
    public void setName(String newName) {
        this.name = newName;
    }
}
```


### Common Practices

- Prefix getters with `get` and setters with `set`, followed by the capitalized attribute name.
- Keep member variables private and only access them via getters/setters.
- Use validation inside setters if necessary (e.g., only accept values in a certain range)[4][3][5].

## Stack Overflow

### What Is Stack Overflow (Error)

- A **stack overflow** error occurs when a program exceeds the memory allocated for its call stack, typically due to deep or infinite recursion or large allocations on the stack.
- The stack uses a last-in, first-out (LIFO) method to manage function calls and local variables.
- Exceeding the stack's limit usually causes a program to crash[6][7][8].

### Stack Overflow Website

- **Stack Overflow** is one of the largest online Q&A communities for programmers, launched in 2008.
- Provides a platform where users can ask programming questions, answer others, and vote on quality of content.
- Features reputation points and badges as part of its gamification system.
- As of mid-2025, Stack Overflow has over 29 million registered users and more than 24 million questions.
- Topics span all major programming languages and frameworks, with JavaScript, Python, and Java being among the most discussed[9][10].

#### How It Works

- Users post detailed programming questions.
- Other members respond with answers, which can be commented, edited, and voted up or down.
- The best answers rise to the top, helping future visitors find reliable solutions quickly.
- Reputation and privileges grow with quality contributions[9][10].
