## What is `this`?

- `this` refers to the *execution context* of a functionâ€”that is, the object to which the function belongs.
- In the **global scope**:
  - In a browser: `this` is the `window` object.
  - In Node.js: `this` is an empty object (`{}`).

### Key Point

- The value of `this` depends on how a function is *called*, **not** how or where it is defined.

## JavaScript Execution Contexts

- Every function call creates its *own execution context*.
- The call stack manages these contexts, beginning with the global execution context.
- Nested function calls can result in confusion about what `this` refers to, especially inside inner functions.

## Problems with `this` in Nested Functions

- When a method contains inner functions (or is passed as a callback), `this` can lose its reference to the original object.
- This can cause bugs, such as a method intended to change object properties failing because it modifies the wrong `this` context.

## The `.call()` Method

`.call()` is a built-in JavaScript function that allows you to *explicitly* set what `this` should be when invoking a function.

### Syntax

```js
functionName.call(object, arg1, arg2, ...);
```

- The **first parameter** to `.call()` is the object that should become `this` inside the function.
- Any further parameters are passed normally to the function.

### Why Use `.call()`?

- To ensure that functions operate in the correct context, especially when `this` might otherwise refer to the global object or be `undefined`.

## Practical Example

Suppose you have an object method that sets a username, but it doesn't work as intended because of the `this` context:

```js
function setUsername(username) {
  this.username = username;
}

const user = { name: 'Chai' };
setUsername.call(user, 'CodeGuru');
// user now has username: "CodeGuru"
```

- Using `.call(user, ...)` ensures `setUsername` modifies the `user` object, not the global scope.

## Related Methods: `.bind()` and `.apply()`

- **`.bind()`**: Creates a new function with a bound context (does not invoke it immediately).
- **`.apply()`**: Like `.call()`, but takes arguments as an array.

## Best Practices

- Use `.call()` when you want to temporarily set the context for a single function invocation.
- For callbacks or event listeners that need a persistent context, use `.bind()`.
- Always be cautious of nested functions: `this` can easily be lost in callbacks or inside functions defined within methods.
